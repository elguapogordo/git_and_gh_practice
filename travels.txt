my favorite travel experiences involve europe. i lived in england for three years but have also visited italy, and germany. these trips have exposed me to some wonderful new food and drink. mead, ale, hefeweizen, eiswein, gnocchi, gelato, and indian/pakistani food are all things i have loved since finding them.
no love for ipa, though. only had one that was good, and it was in reno.
